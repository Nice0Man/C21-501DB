Project Description
The project involves the development of a custom database management system using Python. The system aims to provide functionalities such as data storage, retrieval, manipulation, and querying. The team will be using Python's built-in data structures and libraries to implement the database functionalities.

Goals
Design and implement the core functionalities of the database system.
Develop a user-friendly interface for interacting with the database.
Ensure the reliability and efficiency of data storage and retrieval processes.
Test the database system thoroughly to identify and fix any issues or bugs.
Document the project thoroughly to facilitate future maintenance and development.
Project Structure
The project will be structured into multiple modules, each responsible for different aspects of the database system such as data storage, indexing, querying, and user interface. The team will collaborate closely to ensure seamless integration of these modules into the final product.

Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language for developing the database system.
Git: Version control system for managing the project's source code.
GitHub: Hosting platform for collaboration and project management.
